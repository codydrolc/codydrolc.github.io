My work has been published in Policy Studies Journal.\nOfficials at all levels of government rely on expert administrators and auditing organizations to provide performance information and identify problem areas in public agencies. Important work has considered how elected officials hold government agencies accountable, but scholars largely ignore oversight mechanisms within agencies that monitor the implementation and formation of public policies and communicate information to elected officials and agency leaders. My dissertation research explores the implications of government-wide oversight initiatives (e.g., Inspectors General and Government Accountability Office) in enhancing administrative accountability, effective oversight, and agency performance. Through three empirical chapters, I examine (1) oversight performed by civil servants; (2) monitoring of agency activities by Offices of the Inspector General; and (3) the influence of elected officials on non-partisan institutions tasked with overseeing government agencies. My dissertation demonstrates that even non-partisan, expert oversight is subject to political manipulation and has implications for our understanding of accountability, performance, and effective oversight.\nA copy of my CV is available here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome!\nI am currently a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Missouri.
