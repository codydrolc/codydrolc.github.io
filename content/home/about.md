## Biography

Welcome! 

I am currently a PhD candidate in political science at the [University of Missouri](https://politicalscience.missouri.edu/) and a research assistant with the [Truman School of Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of administrative politics, public policy, and human resources. 

My dissertation research considers how bureaucracies and elected officials monitor problems related to the implementation of public policies. Although many public programs are successfully implemented, problems that disrupt service delivery or the intended outcomes are common and seemingly inevitable. In the three empirical chapters, I explore how and why bureaucrats identify problems, the monitoring agenda of federal inspectors general, and how members of Congress use of the Government Accountability Office to assist in policy making and administrative oversight. 

A copy of my CV is available [here](files/Drolc_CV.pdf).
