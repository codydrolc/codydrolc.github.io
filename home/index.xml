      <description>blockquote { font-size: 14px }  Publications Forthcoming. &amp;ldquo;Taking Time (and Space) Seriously: How Scholars Falsely Infer Policy Diffusion from Model Misspecification.&amp;rdquo; (with Christopher Gandrud and Laron K. Williams), Policy Studies Journal
 Abstract
Scholars have long been interested in how policies and ideas spread from one observation to another. Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of policy diffusion present unique challenges that empirical researchers often neglect. Scholars often use temporally-lagged spatial lags (TLSL)—such as the number (or percentage) of prior adopters in a neighborhood—to test various mechanisms of delayed policy diffusion but are largely unaware of two under-appreciated issues.</description>
